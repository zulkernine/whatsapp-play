#TODO all code: return browser.close and use it instead use exit

#TODO target_search: Add a whaaaaaat menu
#FIXME target_search: False positive group -> Groups name use the same div as contact status,
        so we need to verify if target name is in title, not in status. But, 
        sometimes the status contain the target name and shows up as 
        false-positive group. 
        WHERE WE CAN FIX? __checking_group_list


#TODO io: Wait for the last message to be sent before closing the browser
